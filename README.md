In this challenge I had the task to update the code for the website, Horiseon. 

I had to make sure it was up to accessibility standards.

The html semantics were updated.

I added a header,aside,nav's,and footer to have a structured code.

I added the nessacery alt's to describe the imgs.

The tilte was also changed to the website purpose.

Here are the links to the code:
